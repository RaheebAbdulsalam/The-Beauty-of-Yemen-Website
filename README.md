# The-Beauty-of-Yemen-Website

The main focus and goal of this website is to inform and show the beauty of Yemen to the world and change their thoughts on Yemen as a place of War.I have provided the users of the website with all the information needed to discover about Yemen, such as the history, the location, and the culture. As well as, I have identified and described five of the most famous landmarks in Yemen. The description of the landmarks is regarding their location, history, architecture and etc. Each description has an image showing the amazing view of that landmark. This will help tourists who want to visit Yemen and give them the opportunity to plan ahead for their journey and have a clear knowledge about the places that they are going to visit and where are they located. 

The website has a consistent layout with a consistent menu bar on every page of the website for ease of navigation between all pages of the website.  Also, the website is very interesting because it contains some interactive features, such as a video on the home page where users will have the opportunity to watch before they start discovering about Yemen. Also, I have included a contact form which will be used by the visitors for general comments or if they have any question about Yemen.The main colour scheme theme of the whole website goes as follows: #000000 (Black), #800000(Maroon), #ffffff(White). These colors reflect the flag of Yemen and by choosing these colors the theme of my website is related to the purpose which is mainly talking about Yemen. I have lifted the background of every page white to make the content easier to read for the majority. 

Below is a screenshot of the Home page:
