            Yemen is
            one of the most important countries in the middle east that has an interesting
            cultural history.
            Yemen has interesting elements of the ancient world, and some unique natural wonders too.
            It has a wealth of Beauty and Culture which can attract people from all over the world to visit there.
            <br><br>Here
            is a list of the five most famous landmarks:
        </p>
                 <!--The first landmark(Stone house) -->
        <div class="site1">
            <h2 style="font-size: 34pt;margin-left: 2%; color:maroon;text-decoration-line: underline;">Stone house (Dar
                al-Hajar)</h2>
            <p style="margin-left: 2% ;font-size: 14pt;line-height: 35px;font-family:PT Serif ,serif">Dar Al-Hajar (Rock
                Palace). Located in
                northwest of Sana'a in the middle of Wadi Dhahr, 25 km away
                from
                the city center. The first mention of Wadi Dhahr was in the seventh century B.C. as it was inhabited
                by
                prehistoric people.<br>
                It is the most popular symbol of Yemen seen on posters and in magazines.
                The fame of the valley goes back many ages ago, as indicated by drawings found on the valley rocks,
                which led archeologists to conclude that the valley was inhabited before recorded history. The rock
                palace was built by al-Imam Mansour, dating back to 1786. It was once an old Jewish
                community
                situated on a huge protruding rock. Its ridges were carved by the people in the past for
                fortification.
                The only way in and plausible way out is a wide wooded Gate that gives access to this deserted
                village.<br>
                Currently, the building houses a museum. This pattern of Yemeni architecture is a seven-storey
                building
                with 35 rooms, pantries and kitchens. Around the palace there are five ruined watch towers.</p>

        <br>
        <!--The second landmark(Socatra Island) -->
        <div class="site2">
            <h2 style="font-size: 34pt;margin-left: 2%; color:maroon;text-decoration-line: underline;">The Otherworldly
                Socotra Island</h2>
            <p style="margin-left: 2% ;font-size: 14pt;line-height: 35px;font-family:PT Serif ,serif">This is one of the
                world heritages sites of UNESCO in Yemen. This island is famous worldwide for its
                alien planet like beauty and features. It has amazing rugged terrain filled with rocks, blue green
                sea,
                sandy beaches some of which has massive sand dunes. But special mention must be done to those Dragon
                Blood Trees popularly known as Bottle Trees. These amazing trees have thick stems, and the upper
                part is
                raher slim than the lower portion. When a tree is full grown and has its leaves and branches it
                certainly looks something out of the world. Visitors flock to this island in Yemen to see this
                natural
                wonder.</p>

            </h2>
            <p style="margin-left: 2% ;font-size: 14pt;line-height: 35px;font-family:PT Serif ,serif">If you love
                architectural wonders then you should pay a visit to Shaharah in north west Yemen to see
                this
                old architectural wonder. Shaharah is a village situated in a mountainous region. This bridge was
                built
                in 17th century over a deep gorge. It was a limestone structure that still holds and strikes awe to
                whoever sees it.</p>
